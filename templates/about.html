    <p>
      Our platform makes data from manufacturing processes and other disparate
      systems more accessible with a simple drag and drop interface and intuitive
      workflows, data can be explored up to 5 dimensions. Wiz can also be used to
      perform real-time monitoring and advanced analysis from a web browser.

    <h1>Context</h1>
    <p>
      In an age of big-data, understanding and visualising data is as important as
      its collection. Dr Peyman Z. Moghadam’s team from the Department of Chemical
      and Biological Engineering at the University of Sheffield have developed an
      interactive big-data visualisation tool to address both fronts by allowing
      exploration of data beyond what static images can offer. Built in Python, the
      app called Wiz combines the accessibility of web applications with the
      robustness to interactively analyse datasets up to 5 dimensions (5D). With the
      explosion of information streaming capabilities and the emphasis on
      digitalisation, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we
      expect Wiz to serve as an invaluable tool to have a broad impact in our world
      of big-data.

    <h1>Digital Transformation</h1>
    <p>
      One key aspect of digitalisation is to turn data into value for companies. The
      data analytics/visualisation software that will be developed in this project is
      key to unlock the potential of big-data to provide actionable insights to drive
      business growth for many industries in the next 10-20 years. The software
      called Wiz is a one-stop shop for real-time data analysis and visualisation.
      Scientists and non-scientists alike can use Wiz to better understand their
      data. Further, because Wiz is web-based, anyone with a dataset and a browser
      can use it: without the need to code or even download a software.

    <p>
      Wiz is now up and running on Siemens’ MindSphere as an app. We are now able to
      read data in “real-time” and unravel the complexity of data by splitting their
      relationships through 5 dimensional (5D) visual analytics, performing
      multivariate data analysis such as principal component and linear discriminant
      analyses, all in vivid, publication-ready Figures!
